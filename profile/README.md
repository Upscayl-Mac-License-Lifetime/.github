 ## Overview
 
 ### Enhanced Workflow for macOS
Upscayl is implemented as an AI-powered image upscaling tool with attention to macOS-native workflows and predictable performance. The interface groups resolution enhancement, batch processing and quality presets in a way that reduces friction during image enlargement, keeping navigation consistent whether the user is upscaling photos or restoring old images. Internal routines follow a local processing model, ensuring that core operations stay available even when the system is offline or under network constraints.

### Optimized for macOS-Native Workflows
By aligning tightly with macOS interface conventions, Upscayl integrates cleanly into the broader desktop environment. It respects standard behaviors for windows, menus and keyboard shortcuts, and interacts smoothly with Finder dialogs, file pickers and notifications. This makes it straightforward to combine the app with other tools in the stack, whether the workflow involves AI image upscaling and enhancement, communication, or structured project work.

### Localized Resource Handling & Customization
The internal engine is structured around configurable profile settings so that users can adapt Upscayl to their own environment. Options may include how accounts are managed, how histories are retained, how projects are indexed, how logs are stored or how frequently state is refreshed. Because processing runs locally, these customizations remain reliable in controlled networks, studio spaces and secure offices where external dependencies are limited or unavailable.

### Cross-Hardware Optimization
Upscayl is tuned to run effectively on both Intel and Apple Silicon based Macs, balancing CPU and memory usage to keep the interface responsive while heavier tasks run in the background. Long operations such as indexing, synchronization, analysis passes or large project refresh cycles are managed by internal task schedulers, so that pointer movement, scrolling and window updates remain smooth even under load.
